Please see the attached PDFs.  There are instructions included in each one.  Please ask that Gurvijay spend no more than 90 mins max on it all – I don’t want it to detract from their personal life. 

For the “project task” feel free to use AI to help – but make sure it makes sense. 

For the “tech questions” – feel free to Google/StackOverflow for help but try not to use AI for these.

There’s no rush for the results – sometime next week maybe?  If any questions more than happy for Gurvijay to email me directly.
